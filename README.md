## Project Lists

### Rock Paper Scissors Classification | Image Classification

This is an image classification of rock paper scissors hand sign using TensorFlow. The dataset contains 726 image files of rock hand sign, 712 image files of paper hand sign, and 750 image files of scissors.

### Obesity Risk Prediction | Multi-class Prediction

This is a multi-class prediction of obesity risk with 7 target classes. I use three machine learning models, k-NN, SVM, and decision tree. I also implement a data analysis and data visualization in this project.<br>

### Breast Cancer Prediction | Binary Classification

This is a binary classification of breast cancer. The purpose of this work is to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign. I use LinearSVC for the machine learning model. I also implement a data analysis and data visualization in this project.<br>

### Heart Failure Prediction | Binary Classification

This is a binary classification of heart failure. The purpose of this work is to predict whether a patient have a heart disease risk or not. I use five machine learning models, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and k-NN. I also implement a data analysis and data visualization in this project.<br>
